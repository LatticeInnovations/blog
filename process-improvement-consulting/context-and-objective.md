# Context and Objective

## Context
Our client was a multi-specialty hospital that serves patients in a tribal belt in Assam. Most of its patients are of limited financial means, hence services are offered at minimal cost. There are no other healthcare facilities nearby, as a result of which patients sometimes travel for over 6 hours/ 200 km each way to receive outpatient care, in groups of up to ten to save on transport costs.

The hospital is surrounded by jungles that are unsafe to travel through at night. There are no hotels or guest houses nearby. The hospital has accommodations only for IPD patients' families. Therefore, Outpatient Department (OPD) patients require comprehensive consultation on the same day—including lab tests, X-ray, USG and medication. Most patients want to leave by early afternoon—3 pm—so that they cross heavily forested areas before nightfall.

The OPD today serves an average of 206 patients daily, with peaks of up to 400 patients a day in summer months (Apr-Aug). High patient load creates uncertain, long wait times of up to 5 hours, because of which patients worry about being able to leave for home on time. These worries are magnified when some members of a group are delayed, while others are done. 

Hence, there is need to bring predictability in OPD operations, and deliver services within a defined time period.

## Objective
Reduce waiting time for patients by minimizing non-physician time.
