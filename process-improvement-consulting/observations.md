# Observations



## Observer and methods

One consultant from Lattice Innovations observed OPD workflow from December 3-5, 2014. Patient throughput time and stage-wise flow was measured on December 4, 2014, when the OPD had a load of 168 patients. Individual workstations were observed on December 3 and 5. Electronic records of all OPD visits from December 1 to 6, totaling 1,123, or 187 per day, were also analyzed.

### Current Workflow

The complete OPD workflow (pathway) consists of twelve steps, as illustrated below.

&#x20;Patients follow two different pathways, or tracks, based on their healthcare needs. “Slow-track” patients follow all twelve steps, since their condition requires a full workup, with laboratory and/ or radiology investigations.&#x20;

“Fast-track” patients follow the six steps in yellow; they directly receive a prescription and collect medicines.

Across the sample of 1,123 OPD visits from Dec 1 to 6, 46% of all visits were fast-track.

### Current Throughput Times&#xD;

An analysis of Electronic Records for December 4 shows the following:

As evident above, average throughput times are particularly high in early hours. The registration desk opens at 8 am, and doctors report to the OPD at 9 am. Thus, patients arriving at or before 8 am wait for at least an hour.

While the lowest throughput time for fast-track patient was 12 minutes, the average was 136 minutes. Their wait times were significantly increased by slow-track patients.

On December 4, maximum throughput time for a slow-track patient was 346 minutes (5 hr 46 min), and that for a fast-track patient was 248 minutes (4 hr 8 min).

### Wait Time and Value-Added Time

The figure below uses the "journey" of one slow-track patient, ID 14-34098, on Dec 4, to illustrate the high proportion of wait time when compared with value-added time. Value-added time is the time when hospital staff performed activities directly related to diagnosis or treatment.

### Patient Load across the Day

Since throughput time varies significantly across the day, we analyzed patient load for all 1,123 OPD visits from Dec 1 to 6. 75% of all patients are registered by 11 am—the first 2 hours of OPD operation. The balance 25% patients are spread across the remaining 5 hours (11 am to 4 pm). Thus, patient load is skewed, which causes strain on service delivery.

### &#xD;Workstation-wise Load and Capacity

To better understand OPD workflow, individual workstations were observed on Dec 3 and 5. Based on these observations, we calculated the time taken by each workstation counter to serve a patient. The data is reported in seconds.

<table><thead><tr><th width="70" data-type="number">S. No</th><th width="219.333251953125">Workstation</th><th width="158" align="right">time per patient, s</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Registration</td><td align="right">120</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Vital signs</td><td align="right">58</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Consultation</td><td align="right">146</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Investigation data entry</td><td align="right">60</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Investigation billing</td><td align="right">90</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Pathology lab</td><td align="right">105</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>X-ray</td><td align="right">519</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>USG</td><td align="right">insufficient data</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Prescription</td><td align="right">146</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Pharmacy data entry</td><td align="right">60</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Pharmacy billing</td><td align="right">90</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Pharmacy dispensing</td><td align="right">224</td></tr></tbody></table>

Some workstations&#x20;have more than one counters.&#x20;For instance, Pharmacy has a&#x20;total of 4 counters, at which&#x20;tasks 4, 9, 10, 12 are carried out. In contrast, the X-ray workstation has a single counter.
