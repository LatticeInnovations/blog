# Annexures

Annexure 1


Venn-diagram that shows how patients who undergo investigations overlap across the 3 investigation services - Lab, X-Ray and USG.

Of 1,123 ODP visits analyzed, 465 visits, or 41%, availed of Lab investigations. 250 visits did no avail of any other investigations, 136 also had a USG exam, 70 also have an X-Ray, and 9 visits required all three - Lab, X-Ray and USG.\
603 visits lie within the overlapping circles, since there required one or more investigative service - the slow-track. The balance 520 were on the fast-track.

## Annexure 2

The topmost line shows summary statistics and time.\
The screen above, the first table (top left) shows patients who are yet to be seen by a Physician. These patients are assigned to a physician in the bottom right hand corner - a drag and drop interface is recommended for ease of use.\
The second table (top mid) shows slow-track patients who have already undergone investigations fully, and are awaiting the second (diagnosis/ prescription) consultation.\
The third table, top right, shows slow-track patients whose investigations are due for completion.\
Finally, the bottom left corner shows physician-wise statistics. Based on current patient load and historical data, columns for patient allocation targets can also be added to the table.\
S-1 is slow-track consultation, S-2 is slow-track diagnosis/ prescription, and F is fast-track. Color codes - red for slow-track and blue for fast track.
