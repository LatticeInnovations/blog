# Context, Objective & Observations

Context


Our client was a multi-specialty hospital that serves patients in a tribal belt in Assam. Most of its patients are of limited financial means, hence services are offered at minimal cost. There are no other healthcare facilities nearby, as a result of which patients sometimes travel for over 6 hours/ 200 km each way to receive outpatient care, in groups of up to 10 to save on transport costs.

The hospital is surrounded by jungles that are unsafe to travel through at night. There are no hotels or guest houses nearby. The hospital has accommodations only for IPD patients' families. Therefore, Outpatient Department (OPD) patients require comprehensive consultation on the same day—including lab tests, X-ray, USG and medication. Most patients want to leave by early afternoon—3 pm—to reach home before nightfall.

The OPD today serves an average of 206 patients daily, with peaks of up to 400 patients a day in summer months (Apr-Aug). High patient load creates uncertain, long wait times of up to 5 hours, because of which patients worry about being able to leave for home on time, especially when traveling together. Hence, there is need to bring predictability in OPD service delivery, in order to deliver services within a defined time period.

## Objective

Reduce waiting time for patients by minimizing non-physician time.

Observations
------------

One consultant from Lattice Innovations observed OPD workflow from December 3-5, 2014. Patient throughput time and stage-wise flow was measured on December 4, 2014, when the OPD had a load of 168 patients. Individual workstations were observed on December 3 and 5. Electronic Records of all OPD visits from December 1 to 6, totaling 1,123 (187 patients per day) were also analyzed.

### Current Workflow

The complete OPD workflow (pathway) consists of the 12 steps, illustrated on the next page. Patients follow two different pathways, or tracks, based on their healthcare needs. “Slow-track” patients follow all 12 steps, since their condition requires a full workup, with lab and/ or radiology investigations. “Fast-track” patients follow 6 steps (in orange) – they directly receive a prescription and collect medicines.

Across the sample of 1,123 OPD visits from Dec 1 to 6, 46% of all visits were fast-track.

### Current Throughput Times&#xD;

An analysis of Electronic Records for December 4 shows the following:

Figure 2: Average throughput times across the day on Dec 4, split by fast and slow tracks\


As seen in the figure above, average throughput times are particularly high in early hours. The registration desk opens at 8 am, and doctors report to the OPD at 9 am. Thus, patients arriving at or before 8 am wait for at least an hour.

Throughput time for fast-track patients ranged from 12 minutes to as high as 136 minutes on average - their wait times were significantly increased by slow-track patients.

On December 4, maximum throughput time for a slow-track patient was 346 minutes (5 hr 46 min), and that for a fast-track patient was 248 minutes (4 hr 8 min).\


### Wait Time and Value-Added Time

The figure below uses the "journey" of one slow-track patient, ID 14-34098, on Dec 4, to illustrate the high proportion of wait time when compared with value-added time. Value-added time is the time when hospital staff performed activities directly related to diagnosis or treatment.

### Patient Load across the Day

Since throughput time varies significantly across the day, we analyzed patient load for all 1,123 OPD visits from Dec 1 to 6. 75% of all patients are registered by 11 am—the first 2 hours of OPD operation. The balance 25% patients are spread across the remaining 5 hours (11 am to 4 pm). Thus, patient load is skewed, which causes strain on service delivery.

### &#xD;Workstation-wise Load and Capacity

To better understand OPD workflow, individual workstations were observed on Dec 3 and 5. Based on these observations, we calculated the time taken by each workstation counter to serve a patient.
