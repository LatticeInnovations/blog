# Process improvement consulting

This section showcases Lattice's first process consulting assignment, completed four months after our inception. The client was gracious enough to allow us to make the content publicly available.

It started with a question posed by the medical superintendent of the hospital.&#x20;

He said, "We are considering expanding our outpatient department's size to help alleviate patient load. Do you think we can do this expansion with a constrained budget?"

We went to the [_gemba_](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]_._ Using the Kaizen (Lean) methodology, we we were able to propose process changes that could increase peak OPD throughput by 25%, while limiting investment in new equipment to only $300.

The recommendations are site-specific, but the principles are generalizable to hospitals even todayâ€”more than a decade later.&#x20;

[^1]: Gemba is a Japanese term that means "place of work". Improvements come from the _gemba_, not from conference rooms.&#x20;
