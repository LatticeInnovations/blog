# Conclusion

We recommend that OPD operations are reconfigured so that physician time available is the only constraint, since the physician is the scarcest resource. Physicians at the hospital work with a high degree of individual efficiency. With operational changes in other supporting areas, their full capacity can be realized, with a consequent increase in OPD capacity by 25% and a reduction in wait times for patients.

Investment needed in new equipment is limited to the purchase of a single centrifuge.&#x20;
